      <p>Spider-Gwen, who also commonly goes by "Ghost-Spider" to hide her identity, Gwen Stacey was created in 1965 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko but her "Spider-Gwen" character was created in 2014 by Jason Latour and Robbi Rodriguez. Gwen Stacey, a 16-17 year old from Chelsea who as well got her powers from a radioactive spider bite, giving her the same powers as Spider-Man. She is from Earth-65 as Miles is from Earth-1610, and the main Spider-Man is from Earth-161, in her universe, Peter Parker is her best friend, he wanted to be speicial like Spider-Gwen so he experimented with himself and turned into the lizard but lost control, so Gwen accidentally killed him in their fight while she didn't know that was Peter, blaming herself for his death when she did find out. She's arguably the third most popular Spider-Man variant appearing in most of the same media as Miles Morales.</p>
