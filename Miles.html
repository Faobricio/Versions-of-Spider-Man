      <p>Spider-Man, created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli in 2011, is the alter ego of Miles Morales, a typically 13 year old from Brooklyn who also got his powers from a radioactive spider, giving him the same abilities as Spider-Man with the adition of two powers which is a bio-electric charge/electrical powers, and invisibility at times. His story differs like in some where him and Peter team up or traveling the Spider-Verse, but his main story is taking the mantle of Spider-Man after the death of Peter Parker and continuing to protect the city. Miles is still somewhat recent being created in 2011 but he is no doubt the most popular Spider-Man variant and a fan favorite.</p>
